This song has been a long time in the making. I wrote it over a year ago, in October and November 2014, but the core idea goes back years beyond that (and in fact I've talked about the theme on this very blog). I could say a lot of things about this song, and probably will at some point, but I don't have the time right now. So without further ado:

[Stream for free on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/deltawhy/home-is-where-i-keep-my-guitar)  
[Download for $1 on Bandcamp](https://michaellimiero.bandcamp.com/track/home-is-where-i-keep-my-guitar)

This song was written, performed, recorded, and produced by me in my bedroom studio. Lyrics, music, and recording are (c) 2015-2016 Michael Limiero, All Rights Reserved. In other words, please share the link but don't share the download.

Special thanks to my friends at GTCCF for encouraging me to record this song. And a shout-out to Judah and the Lion, whose song *Mason-Dixon Line* was a huge source of inspiration for this one. Give them a listen if you enjoyed it.
