This is such a beautiful song, but I never liked the ending, so I rewrote it. My lyrics, this recording, and my arrangement are available under a Creative Commons BY-NC license, meaning you are free to download and distribute them as long as you give me credit and don't make any money.

_Update: I should probably credit Leonard Cohen's [original version](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallelujah_(Leonard_Cohen_song)). I should also mention that the feel and message of the song varies a lot between its 200 covers.Â Cohen himself released two versions of this song on two different albums - one biblical and more hopeful, the other secular and more depressing. He wrote around 80 verses, but only selected a few for these final arrangements. The version you probably know is a cover by John Cale and was used in the movie _Shrek_. My version is most closely based on [Jeff Buckley's cover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8AWFf7EAc4)._

I heard there was a secret chord  
That David played and it pleased the Lord  
But you don't really care for music, do you?  
It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth  
The minor fall and the major lift  
The baffled king composing hallelujah  

Hallelujah (x4)

Your faith was strong, but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you  
She tied you to a kitchen chair,  
She broke your throne and she cut your hair  
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah  

Hallelujah (x4)

Seems like I've been here before  
I know this room and I've walked this floor  
I used to be alone before I knew You  
So now the song that I sing at night  
Is wondering when I will find the light  
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah  

Hallelujah (x4)

"Child," I can hear You say,  
"However far you run away,  
Remember that my love will still pursue you.  
Remember when I moved in you  
And the Holy Dove was moving too  
And every breath you drew was hallelujah"  

Hallelujah (x4)

Surely there's a God above  
For the mystery and the joy of love  
Is when you're broken, how it can renew you  
Suddenly, I feel Your hand  
And in Your presence I cannot stand  
I'm on my knees proclaiming hallelujah  

Hallelujah (x12)
