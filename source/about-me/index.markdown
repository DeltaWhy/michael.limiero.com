[![](http://limiero.com/michael/files/2012/03/limero_senior_019_r1_small-240x300.jpg)](http://limiero.com/michael/files/2012/03/limero_senior_019_r1_small.jpg)My name is Michael Limiero and I am currently a second-year computer science major at Georgia Tech. My interests include programming and web design, music, and [speedcubing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing). I picked up a book on QBASIC at age seven, and I have loved programming ever since. I have been coding web sites for about the same length of time, but lately I've gotten more serious about it. I redesigned [my school's website](http://stockdale.kernhigh.org) during the 2009-2010 school year, over the summer I created this blog, and between December 2010 and April 2011 I worked on a website for [Soul Rest Ministries](http://www.soulrest.org).

I spent about five years as a volunteer worship leader at [my church](http://www.lifejourneychurch.com), where I led about twice a month. I started out playing piano and keyboard, but I learned to play guitar about five years ago and it has been my main instrument ever since. I play both acoustic and electric guitar, and I have also written several worship songs.

One of my main hobbies is speedcubing, or solving the Rubik's Cube and similar puzzles as fast as possible. I currently average about 18 seconds for a regular 3x3 cube, or 35 seconds with one hand, using a DaYan ZhanChi speedcube and the Fridrich method with 2-look last layer. I can also solve the cube blindfolded in under 2 minutes with Old Pochmann. I have a medium-sized puzzle collection, although I'm not very fast on any of my other puzzles. I highly recommend badmephisto's [website](http://www.badmephisto.com) and [Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/badmephisto) for anyone who wants to learn to solve the cube. [Lars Petrus](http://lar5.com/cube/index.html) also has a good method which I used for about three years before switching to Fridrich (the most common "advanced" method).
